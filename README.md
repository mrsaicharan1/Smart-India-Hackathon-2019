- [Shreyansh Dwivedi](https://github.com/shreyanshdwivedi)
- [Vinit Mankar](https://github.com/vin-man)

### Proposed Solution:

- Developed a prototype of a product for Intelligent Natural Langauge Search of R&D data by implementing NLP algorithms for answering in-general queries.
- Tracking specific molecule/therapy based progress in a more sophisticated procedure.
- Boosted our project by visualizing the therapy procedures and research progress over the years.
- Enabled interactive data exploration for all the data.
- Feature to dynamically update all the stats and results with increasing data by applying classification using Naive Bayes.

We are also currently in talks with Dr.Reddyâ€™s to take this onto the production level.
